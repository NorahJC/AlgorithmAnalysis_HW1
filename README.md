Write programs that accomplish the following tasks. You need to implement GUI (Graphic User Interface).

1) Merge sort involves recursively splitting the array into 2 parts, sorting and finally merging them. A variant of merge sort is called 3-way merge sort where instead of splitting the array into 2 parts we split it into 3 parts. Write a program for 3-way merge sort for a list of 99 numbers.
2) Write a program for quick-sorting a list of at most 100 numbers using the median of first three elements.
3) Write a program for insertion sorting a list of at most 20 numbers using the binary search to insert each pivot.

You may form a group with 2 to 4 persons. If your group has less than 2 person, you need to contact me.

Each group needs to do a 5 min presentation around 2 weeks later. Each student in the group will be graded equally unless it was reported to me and confirmed that some student did not do sufficient work for the project. You may also record a video with your group members and upload it to facebook.

The deadline is 11:59 PM Oct 4.
